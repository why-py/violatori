# violatori
Violatori Ransomware(Violateware) written in python

you can edit send_message function with your own API or other code to send key and platform info.

after the encrypt function , some .txt and .html files will be dynamically generated with unique code and the email & wallet in source code.

you can edit them too.

to prevent this code from running on your own system, you have to create a .txt file called "seeifexists.txt" in C:\Users\Username\

the program checks for this file and if exists,exits the program.

and if not, it creates this .txt file to prevent multiple parallel executions and data loss.

decrypter will be added soon.
